    "The default lookup tables have been developed and tested for the Moon. However, `roughness` allows users to generate custom lookup tables for any body with a custom thermal model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shadow_lookup` table is a lookup table of probabilities that a given surface facet is in shadow. It is generated using a raytracing algorithm applied to a self-affine fractal rough surface with a default Hurst exponent chosen for lunar applications. The default surface should function for most rough planetary surfaces, but can be regenerated ysing the `roughness.make_los_table` module as described in [shadow_tables](../shadow_tables/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `temperature_lookup` table is a lookup table of surface temperatures for each surface facet. Any thermal model can be used to generate this table and it can have arbitrary dimensionality, the only requirement is that the output is an `xarray.Dataset` with a data variable `tsurf` and contains at least the `theta` and `az` coordinates, corresponding to surface facet slope and azimuth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default temperature table used in `roughness` was developed for the Moon using KRC ([krc.mars.asu.edu](https://krc.mars.asu.edu)) and **is** body-specific due to the unique thermal environment of each planetary body. Below is the temperature Dataset with coordinates relevant to predicting surface temperatures on the Moon. See [temperature_tables](../temperature_tables/) for more details."
